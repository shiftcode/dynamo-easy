Abstracts away the complexity of the low level aws dynamosdk. Provides an easy to use fluent api to for requests and supports typescript decorators,
to define some metadata for your models. You don't need to care about the mapping of javascript types to their dynamo types any more. We got you covered.

Checkout the full technical api documentation [here](https://shiftcode.github.io/dynamo-easy/).

Built with :heart: by [shiftcode](https://www.shiftcode.ch).

# Get Started
```
@Model()
class Person{
  @PartitionKeyUUID() 
  id: string
  
  name: string
}

const dynamoStore = new DynamoStore(Person)

// add a new item
dynamoStore.put({name: 'peter'})
  .exec().subscribe(()=>{
    console.log('peter was saved')
  })

// search for all persons which start with the character 'p'
dynamoStore.query()
  .where('name').startsWith('p')
  .exec()
  .subscribe((persons: Person[])=>{
    console.log('got persons')
  })
  
  
// returns all persons
dynamoStore.scan()
  .exec()
  .subscribe((persons: Person[]) => {
    console.log('all persons')
  })

```

Want to use this library with Angular (>4) [checkout our angular-service](TODO).

# Decorators
Decorators are used to add some metadata to our model classes, relevant to our javascript-to-dynamo mapper.

This is an experimental feature and requires to set the following typescript compiler options:
 
- "experimentalDecorators": true
- "emitDecoratorMetadata": true

Additionally we rely on the reflect-metadata (https://www.npmjs.com/package/reflect-metadata) library for reflection api.

To get started with decorators just add a [@Model()](https://shiftcode.github.io/dynamo-easy/modules/_decorator_impl_model_model_decorator_.html) Decorator to any typescript class. 

If you need to read the metadata by hand for some purpose, use the [MetadataHelper](https://shiftcode.github.io/dynamo-easy/classes/_decorator_metadata_metadata_helper_.metadatahelper.html) to read the informations.

We make heavy usage of compile time informations about our models and the property types.
Here is a list of the types that can be retrieved from compile time information for the key design:type. (The metadata will only be added if at least one decorator is
present on a property)

- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Array (no generics)
- Custom Types
- ES6 types like Set, Map will be mapped to Object when calling for the type via Reflect.get(design:type), so we need some extra info.

Generic information is never available due to some serialization limitations at the time of writing.

## Model

### Custom TableName
Here is the rule how a table name is built `${kebabCase(modelName)}s` so for a model called Product the table will be named products, this is a default implementation.

There are two possibilities to change the name:

- override the name using the tableName parameter @Model({tableName: tableName})
- provide a TableNameResolver function when instantiating a DynamoStore. This method will receive the default table name 
  (either resolved using the model name or custom value when a tableName was provided in @Model decorator)

# Mapper

## Types

We do the mapping from javascript objects to dynamodb types for you in requests and responses

Simple Type (no decorators required to work)
- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Null
- Array
- Date (we only support MomentJS)

Complex Types (properties with these types need some decorators to work properly)
- Set<simpleType | complexType>
- Map
- Array<complexType>

| TS Type       | Dynamo Type   |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| String        | S             |
| Number        | N             |
| Boolean       | BOOL          |
| moment.Moment | S (ISO-8601 formatted) |
| null          | NULL          |
| Array         | L, (S,N,B)S   |
| ES6 Set       | L, (S,N,B)S   |
| Object       | M   |
|----|------|
| Binary        | Not Supported |
| ES6 Map       | Not Supported   |
| Date          | Not Supported |

## Custom Attribute Mapping
It is always possible to define a custom mapping strategy, just implement the [MapperForType](https://shiftcode.github.io/dynamo-easy/interfaces/_mapper_for_type_base_mapper_.mapperfortype.html) class.

## Collection Mapping (Array & Set)

### Array
Javascript Arrays with a items of type String, Number or Binary will be mapped to a S(et) type, by default all other types are mapped to L(ist) type.
If the items have a complex type it will be mapped to a L(ist).

### Set
An instance of ES6 Set type will be mapped to a S(et) type if the type of the items is supported (String, Number, Binary), otherwise it is mapped to a L(ist).  

When one of the following decorators is present, the value is always mapped to a L(ist).

- @SortedSet(itemType?: ModelClazz) - only L(ist) type preserves order
- @TypedSet(itemType?: ModelClazz) - if the itemType is not one of String | Number | Binary
- @TypedArray()

## Date
Right now we only support [MomentJS](http://momentjs.com/) Dates.

If you want to explicitly mark a property to be a Date use the @Date() decorator. If we find a moment value we automatically map it to a String (using ISO-8601 format).
When coming from db we do a regex test for ISO-8601 format and map it back to a moment object.

## Enum
Enum values are persisted as Numbers (index of enum).

# Request API
To start making requests create an instance of [DynamoStore](https://shiftcode.github.io/dynamo-easy/classes/_dynamo_dynamo_store_.dynamostore.html) and execute the desired operation using the provided api.
We support all the common dynamodb operations:

- Put
- Get
- Update
- Delete
- Scan
- Query
- MakeRequest (generic low level method for special scenarios)

There is always the possibility to access the Params object directly to add values which are not covered with our api.

# Authentication
In a real world scenario you'll have some kind of authentication to protect your dynamodb ressources. You can customize on how to authenticate when providing a custom
SessionValidityEnsurer function to the DynamoStore when creating a new instance.
The default implementation is a no-op function.

## Session Validity Ensurer
Here is an example of an implementation using amazon cognito

```javascript
function sessionValidityEnsurer(): Observable<boolean> {
  return Observable.of(this.isLoggedIn())
    .switchMap(isLoggedIn => {
       if (isLoggedIn) {
          this.logger.debug('withValidSession :: cognitoService.isLoggedIn() -> we have a valid session -> proceed')
          return Observable.of(true)
        } else {
          this.logger.debug('withValidSession :: cognitoService.isLoggedIn() -> user is not logged in or token expired, try to get a new session')
          return this.getUser()
            .catch((err, caught): Observable<boolean> => {
              this.logger.error('withValidSession :: there was an error when refreshing the session', err)
              throw new AuthError('SC_UNAUTHENTICATED', 'Could not refresh the token' + JSON.stringify(err))
            })
            .do(user => this.logger.debug('withValidSession :: we got new valid session', user))
        }
      })
      .map((value: boolean | CognitoUser) => {
        return
      })
  }
```

## Expressions ([AWS Doc](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.html))
By default we create a substitution placeholder for all the attributes, just to not implement a [blacklist](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ReservedWords.html) with reserved words in the context of aws dynamodb.

attributename: age

```
expression: '#age = :age' 
attributeExpressionNames: {'#age': 'age'}
attributeExpressionValues: {':age': {N: '10'}}
```

this works seemlesly for top level attribtues, but if we wanna build an expression for where the attribute needs to be accessed with a document path, we need some special logic
nested attribute: person.age

```
attributeExpressionNames: {'#person':'person', '#age': 'age'}
attributeExpressionValues: {':age': {N: '10'}}
expression: '#person.#age = :age'
```

we can't use #personAge as a placeholder for 'person.age' because if the dot is part of an attribute name it is not treated as a metacharacter compared to when using directly in expression, so
the above solution needs to be used

these are the accessor rules for nested attribute types
- [n] — for list elements
- . (dot) — for map elements

# Development

## NPM scripts
 - `npm t`: Run test suite
 - `npm start`: Runs `npm run build` in watch mode
 - `npm run test:watch`: Run test suite in [interactive watch mode](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/cli.html#watch)
 - `npm run test:prod`: Run linting and generate coverage
 - `npm run build`: Generage bundles and typings, create docs
 - `npm run lint`: Lints code
 - `npm run commit`: Commit using conventional commit style ([husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) will tell you to use it if you haven't :wink:)

## Automatic releases
Use the npm comand `npm run commit`, which is a convenient way to create conventional commits. Those messages are used to run [semantic releases](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release),
which publishes our code automatically on github and npm, plus generates automatically a changelog. This setup is highly influenced by [Kent C. Dodds course on egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-write-an-open-source-javascript-library)

## Git Hooks
We use 2 git hooks:

`precommit`
- to format the code with Prettier :nail_care:
- to check if the commit message follows a [conventional commit message](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog)

`prepush`
- to check if the code can be built running `npm run build`
- to check if all tests pass
